A-MAZE-ing!
A-MAZE-ing is a simple multimode maze solver game. Players can choose between an AI Race mode and normal mode, where they can choose between easy, normal, and hard levels
AI Race requires the player to race against an AI to a fixed exit. Normal mode is a normal maze solver, but the exit randomly changes location every set amount of seconds, and 
enemies will be chasing you.
